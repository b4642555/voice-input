"""What an utterance means for selected text, and the special utterances.

Speaking with text selected replaces it (as typing would). There are no spoken commands on a selection
(2026-09-30): the hotkey does it: a double tap deletes, a double tap held deletes and dictates in its place.

A bare punctuation name (逗號, 句號, 驚嘆號 …) is typed as the mark itself; only when the whole utterance is exactly
the name, so 逗號很重要 is dictated as spoken. The same goes for the two commands (2026-10-07, each a setting):
換行 presses Shift+Enter, 送出 presses Enter.

An utterance on a selected 。 (setting, 2026-10-07) continues the sentence: the 。 becomes ， and moves to the end
(今天很好。明天 → 今天很好，我們去公園。明天).
